The parties agree as follows:

1. DEFINITIONS
1.1 "Affiliate" means any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with a party, where "control" means ownership of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or the power to direct management.
1.2 "Confidential Information" means all information of any kind disclosed by or on behalf of the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party, whether in written, oral, visual, electronic, or other form, whether or not marked or identified as confidential, and whether disclosed before or after the Effective Date, including without limitation business, technical, financial, customer, product, pricing, marketing, and trade secret information.
1.3 "Representatives" means the Receiving Party's employees, officers, directors, contractors, and professional advisers (including attorneys and accountants) who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose (defined below) and who are bound by confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those in this Agreement.
1.4 "Purpose" means evaluating and, if appropriate, pursuing a potential business relationship between the parties.

2. CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS
2.1 Non-Use and Non-Disclosure. The Receiving Party shall (a) use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose, and (b) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except as expressly permitted under this Agreement.
2.2 Standard of Care. The Receiving Party shall protect the Confidential Information using at least the same degree of care it uses to protect its own confidential information of similar importance, but in no event less than reasonable care.
2.3 Limited Access. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information only to its Representatives who have a need to know for the Purpose, and the Receiving Party shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its Representatives.
2.4 No Reverse Engineering. The Receiving Party shall not disassemble, decompile, or reverse engineer any prototypes, samples, software, or other tangible items provided as Confidential Information, except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by law.

3. EXCLUSIONS
Confidential Information does not include information that the Receiving Party can demonstrate by competent written evidence:
3.1 is or becomes generally available to the public through no breach of this Agreement by the Receiving Party;
3.2 was rightfully known by the Receiving Party without restriction on use or disclosure prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party;
3.3 is rightfully received by the Receiving Party from a third party without restriction on use or disclosure and without breach of any obligation to the Disclosing Party; or
3.4 was independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the Confidential Information, provided that the Receiving Party proves such independent development by clear and convincing evidence.

4. PERMITTED DISCLOSURES
4.1 Required Disclosures. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by applicable law, regulation, or legal process (including subpoena or court order), and the Receiving Party will have no obligation to provide notice to the Disclosing Party or to seek any protective order.
4.2 Scope. Any disclosure under Section 4.1 shall be limited to the portion of Confidential Information legally required to be disclosed.

5. TERM AND DURATION
5.1 Term. This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and continues for three (3) years, unless terminated earlier by either party upon thirty (30) days' written notice.
5.2 Survival. The Receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement with respect to Confidential Information disclosed during the Term will survive indefinitely and will not expire, regardless of whether such information qualifies as a trade secret under applicable law.

6. RETURN OF MATERIALS
Upon the Disclosing Party's written request, the Receiving Party shall promptly return or destroy all Confidential Information in its possession or control, including all copies, extracts, and summaries, and the Receiving Party will have no obligation to provide any written certification of compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Receiving Party may retain one archival copy of Confidential Information solely for legal or compliance purposes, subject to the confidentiality obligations in this Agreement.

7. REMEDIES
The Receiving Party acknowledges that unauthorized use or disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages may be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, in the event of a breach or threatened breach, the Disclosing Party may seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity. The Receiving Party further agrees that, for each breach, the Disclosing Party will be entitled to liquidated damages in the amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars (US $250,000), which the parties agree represents a reasonable estimate of damages and is not a penalty.

8. NO LICENSE
Nothing in this Agreement grants the Receiving Party any rights in or to the Confidential Information except as expressly set forth herein. All Confidential Information remains the property of the Disclosing Party.

9. NO OBLIGATION
Nothing in this Agreement obligates either party to proceed with any transaction or relationship, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate discussions at any time.

10. GOVERNING LAW
This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION
The parties agree to first attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement through informal negotiations. If the dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days, either party may bring an action in the state or federal courts located in Delaware, and each party consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

12. NOTICES
All notices under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed given when delivered personally, sent by confirmed email (with a copy sent by another method), sent by nationally recognized overnight courier, or mailed by certified mail (return receipt requested) to the addresses above (or to such other address as a party may designate by notice).

13. ASSIGNMENT

14. AMENDMENTS
Any amendment or modification of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both parties.

15. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect, and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be replaced by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely reflects the parties' original intent.

16. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and communications, whether written or oral.

17. WAIVER
No waiver of any breach of this Agreement will be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach. Any waiver must be in writing and signed by the waiving party.

18. EXECUTION
